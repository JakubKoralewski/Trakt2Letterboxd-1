# Trakt2Letterboxd

This is a simple cross-platform script to export your movies in Trakt to Letterboxd

To use run `python Trakt2Letterboxd.py` on your terminal. This will generate two csv files in the format required by
Letterboxd. One titled 'trakt-exported-history.csv' (for movies you've seen) and one titled 'trakt-exported-watchlist.csv'
(for movies you want to watch).

Note: The script requires Python3.x to run, to install Python go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
