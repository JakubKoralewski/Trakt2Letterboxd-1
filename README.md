# Trakt2LetterboXD

This is a simple cross-platform script to export your movies in Trakt to Letterboxd

To use run `python Trakt2Letterboxd.py` on your terminal. This will generate two csv files in the format required by
Letterboxd. One titled 'trakt-exported-history.csv' (for movies you've seen) and one titled 'trakt-exported-watchlist.csv'
(for movies you want to watch).

**Note**: The script requires:
